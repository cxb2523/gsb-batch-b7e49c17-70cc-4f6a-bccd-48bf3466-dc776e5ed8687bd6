## When to use

Use this skill when the user wants:

- Google News keyword scraper
- a repeatable export of public Google News data as CSV or JSON

Do not use it for private, login-protected or paywalled data.

## What it returns

One JSON row per result. Columns from the Actor's dataset schema:

- `title`: Title
- `source`: Source
- `domain`: Domain
- `publishedAt`: Published
- `url`: URL
- `fullTextStatus`: Status

All 11 declared fields: `references/output-fields.json`.

## Inputs

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `mode` | string | yes | keyword | What to scrape. Each mode reads its own list field below. |
| `queries` | array | no | [] | One or more keyword queries. Google operators such as site:, intitle: and OR are supported. Results are deduplicated across queries. |
| `topics` | array | no | [] | Topic names (WORLD, NATION, BUSINESS, TECHNOLOGY, ENTERTAINMENT, SPORTS, SCIENCE, HEALTH), TOP for top stories, Google News topic hashes/section URLs, or topic URLs. |
| `newsUrls` | array | no | [] | Google News search URLs, topic URLs, RSS search/topic URLs, or RSS/Atom feed URLs to convert into a feed. |
| `rssUrls` | array | no | [] | Any public RSS or Atom feed. Google News links inside the feed are resolved to publisher URLs automatically. |
| `articleUrls` | array | no | [] | Publisher article URLs or Google News article URLs. Every page is fetched and full text is extracted, with a per-record status when a publisher blocks or paywalls it. |
| `language` | string | no | en | Language of the Google News edition. Combined with country in the edition token (for example US:en, DE:de, JP:ja). |
| `country` | string | no | US | Country edition for Google News. The actor always pins the edition so results do not change with the machine's IP. |
| `dateRange` | string | no | any | Recency window. Every item is post-filtered by its real publication time, so items newer than the window never leak. 'custom' uses startDate/endDate. |
| `startDate` | string | no |  | Custom range start (YYYY-MM-DD, inclusive). Also used when dateRange=custom. |
| `endDate` | string | no |  | Custom range end (YYYY-MM-DD, inclusive). Items published after the end are dropped client-side. |
| `maxResultsPerQuery` | integer | no | 20 | Maximum records taken from each Google News feed request (1-100, Google's own cap is about 100). |
| `maxItems` | integer | no | 500 | Hard cap on unique records emitted by the run (1-5000). |
| `extractFullText` | boolean | no | false | Fetch each publisher page and extract its article body, description, author, and image. Default off for fast metadata-only runs. The articleUrls mode always extracts. |

2 more optional fields on the Actor's Input tab.

Example (`references/example-input.json`):

```json
{
  "queries": [
    "artificial intelligence"
  ],
  "maxResultsPerQuery": 3,
  "maxItems": 25,
  "mode": "keyword"
}
```

The input passes the Actor's input schema (checked at every publish). First run: `maxItems` = 25, small enough for the 300-second sync wait; raise it once the rows look right.

## Run it

Set `APIFY_TOKEN`, then call the synchronous endpoint for small and medium runs (it waits up to 300 seconds):

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://api.apify.com/v2/acts/nimbryxo-studio~google-news-keyword-and-full-text-article-scraper/run-sync-get-dataset-items" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $APIFY_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @references/example-input.json > output.json
```

Or with Node 18+: `node scripts/run.mjs [input.json]`.

For large runs, start an async run and read its dataset when it finishes:

```bash
RUN=$(curl -s -X POST "https://api.apify.com/v2/acts/nimbryxo-studio~google-news-keyword-and-full-text-article-scraper/runs" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $APIFY_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @references/example-input.json)
RUN_ID=$(echo "$RUN" | jq -r '.data.id'); DATASET=$(echo "$RUN" | jq -r '.data.defaultDatasetId')
curl -s "https://api.apify.com/v2/actor-runs/$RUN_ID?waitForFinish=60" -H "Authorization: Bearer $APIFY_TOKEN" | jq -r '.data.status'
curl -s "https://api.apify.com/v2/datasets/$DATASET/items?format=json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $APIFY_TOKEN" > output.json
```

## Cost and limits

- Apify bills the Actor's usage on your account; the Actor's Pricing tab shows the current price.
- Keep the limit in the input small for a first run.

## Guardrails

- Public data only. Do not pass cookies, sessions or private account data.
- Do not use the output for spam, harassment or unlawful discrimination.
- Check the target site's terms and local law before running at scale.
