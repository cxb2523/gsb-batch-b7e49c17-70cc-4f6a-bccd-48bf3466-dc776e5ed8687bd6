## When to use

Use this skill when the user wants:

- Google Scholar paper scraper
- a repeatable export of public Google Scholar data as CSV or JSON

Do not use it for private, login-protected or paywalled data.

## What it returns

One JSON row per result. Columns from the Actor's dataset schema:

- `title`: Title
- `name`: Author
- `authors`: Authors
- `year`: Year
- `publication`: Publication
- `citations`: Citations
- `documentType`: Type
- `documentLink`: PDF/HTML
- `link`: Link
- `clusterId`: Cluster
- `scholarUrl`: Scholar URL

All 13 declared fields: `references/output-fields.json`.

## Inputs

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `mode` | string | no | search | What to fetch: paper search, citing papers, or public author profiles. |
| `queries` | array | no |  | Keywords or paper titles to search on Google Scholar (mode=search). Each query runs separately. |
| `clusterIds` | array | no |  | Paper cluster IDs or Google Scholar 'cites=' URLs to list citing papers for (mode=citations). |
| `authorIds` | array | no |  | Google Scholar author IDs or profile URLs to export (mode=authorProfile). |
| `maxItems` | integer | no | 100 | Maximum papers per query or cluster, or papers per author. Google Scholar serves about 10 search results per page. |
| `sortBy` | string | no | relevance | Sort search results by relevance or date (mode=search). |
| `filter` | string | no | all | Keep only PDF or HTML results; applied to returned rows (mode=search). |
| `articleType` | string | no | any | Return all articles or review articles only (mode=search). |
| `newerThan` | integer | no |  | Only include papers published in this year or later (mode=search). |
| `olderThan` | integer | no |  | Only include papers published in this year or earlier (mode=search). |
| `author` | string | no |  | Return papers written by this author, e.g. 'Geoffrey Hinton' (mode=search). |
| `publication` | string | no |  | Return papers from this journal or venue, e.g. 'Nature' (mode=search). |
| `titleOnly` | boolean | no | false | Match the query against paper titles instead of the full text (mode=search). |
| `includeCitationFormats` | boolean | no | false | Also return MLA, APA, Chicago, Harvard, and Vancouver citations for returned rows, within a bounded budget (mode=search or citations). |

1 more optional field on the Actor's Input tab.

Example (`references/example-input.json`):

```json
{
  "queries": [
    "attention is all you need"
  ],
  "maxItems": 25
}
```

The input passes the Actor's input schema (checked at every publish). First run: `maxItems` = 25, small enough for the 300-second sync wait; raise it once the rows look right.

## Run it

Set `APIFY_TOKEN`, then call the synchronous endpoint for small and medium runs (it waits up to 300 seconds):

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://api.apify.com/v2/acts/dataspryva~google-scholar-paper-and-citation-search-scraper/run-sync-get-dataset-items" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $APIFY_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @references/example-input.json > output.json
```

Or with Node 18+: `node scripts/run.mjs [input.json]`.

For large runs, start an async run and read its dataset when it finishes:

```bash
RUN=$(curl -s -X POST "https://api.apify.com/v2/acts/dataspryva~google-scholar-paper-and-citation-search-scraper/runs" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $APIFY_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @references/example-input.json)
RUN_ID=$(echo "$RUN" | jq -r '.data.id'); DATASET=$(echo "$RUN" | jq -r '.data.defaultDatasetId')
curl -s "https://api.apify.com/v2/actor-runs/$RUN_ID?waitForFinish=60" -H "Authorization: Bearer $APIFY_TOKEN" | jq -r '.data.status'
curl -s "https://api.apify.com/v2/datasets/$DATASET/items?format=json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $APIFY_TOKEN" > output.json
```

## Cost and limits

- Apify bills the Actor's usage on your account; the Actor's Pricing tab shows the current price.
- Keep the limit in the input small for a first run.

## Guardrails

- Public data only. Do not pass cookies, sessions or private account data.
- Do not use the output for spam, harassment or unlawful discrimination.
- Check the target site's terms and local law before running at scale.
